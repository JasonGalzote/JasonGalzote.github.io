<h1>What Is this and why am i doing?</h1>

<p>This is the homepage for a final project that im currently working on and the topic for today is,"Should Downloading Free Music off the internet illegal?"</p>

<p>The reason why im discussing about this dilemma today is because i used to download music off the internet which they were from youtube and also a site called Soundcloud which they allow some songs to be downloaded off the internet. However, there are sites on the internet that allows you to copy the youtube url of the music you currently listen to and convert it into an MP3 folder as well as Soundcloud.</p>
